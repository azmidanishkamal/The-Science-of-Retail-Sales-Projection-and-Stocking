The goal of the project is to use the rich e-commerce sales data to develop better demand forecasts and useful inventory optimization information. Retailers who want to make sure that they do not run out of stock, they do not stock a lot, and they do not miss sales opportunities require very dependable and granular demand forecasts because online retail is becoming increasingly competitive, and the customer requirements of a fast delivery are constantly increasing. The project aims at discovering the factors behind the demand variability across product category, season and customer segment by incorporating multi-platform online sales transaction with product attributes, order pattern, fulfillment information and regional customer.

By integrating data analysis (exploratory), forecasting models, and operational indicators, the team will detect inefficiencies in the existing stocking processes and suggest evidence-based strategies to simplify the replenishment processes. The project will provide not only a measure of what products, regions, and channels contribute most to the distortion of inventory but also will offer practical information regarding the optimal levels of stock, the time of reorder, and where predictive accuracy can be a major factor in saving costs. Finally, it is aimed to prove how analytics-based decisions may lead to the better efficiency of operations, customer satisfaction, and the overall sales results in the highly-changing e-commerce world.
